            <h3>The question comes every month: “How’s your pain?”</h3>
            <p>I have a rare genetic disease called multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (M-E-D) that caused my joints to
                deform as I grew. As a result, I’ve had eight joint replacements (both hips twice, both knees, both
                shoulders), plus had my ankles fused. As a result of the MED, my body is a mass of inflammation. I hurt
                from head to toe. Powerful pain medication takes the edge off enough for me to function.</p>
            <p>To get the drugs I need, I visit a pain practice monthly. When my prescriber asks me about my pain each
                time, she isn’t expecting a frank opinion such as, “It sucks.”</p>

            <p>No, she wants me to give a number between 0 (no pain) and 10 (the worst pain imaginable).</p>

            <p> That’s when what I call “The Pain Game” starts.</p>

            <p>1111 Make no mistake: She genuinely cares how I feel and wants an honest answer. But, for me, the
                question is just too fraught.</p>
            <h3>That’s when what I call “The Pain Game” starts.?</h3>
            <p>From my experience, patients get little guidance as to what a pain score is and how best to calculate it.
                I wish my doctors had answered such questions as “What does the scale really measure?” “How do I choose
                a score?” and “Exactly how does my score affect my treatment?” But they haven’t. They just want me to
                give a number they can record in my chart.</p>

            <p>So, without clear guidance, intense calculations run through my mind: If I say a number that’s too low,
                my prescriber may think that I’m fine (which I’m really not) and choose to restrict my prescription.
            </p>
            <p> If I say a number too high — like that terrible 10 — then she might not take me seriously. If I were to
                name a number that large, I feel like I should be writhing on the floor crying uncontrollably because I
                hurt so much. If I report that, she may say to herself, “He’s being so dramatic” (something chronic pain
                sufferers are accused of all the time). </p>
            <p> Even answering 9 seems too high, not so much based on what I feel (sometimes my pain is a 9) but because
                it makes sense to leave some room if things go really wrong. It’s like scoring diving at the Olympics;
                judges don’t want to give early contestants a top score because someone later might do better.</p>

            <p>So, I always say 7 or 8, judging that it will make my pain seem serious but not exaggerated. (Plus, I can
                certainly imagine pain worse than mine.)</p>

            <p> Numbers from 3 to 6 just seem kind of a mid-score that says “medium” pain. The intensity of my pain and
                its effects on me are certainly not medium. </p>

            <p> And I take 0 to 2 as meaning almost no pain at all, which happens only rarely for me. </p>

            <p> Always reporting a 7 or 8 means my pain score doesn’t change much from visit to visit, which is also
                true of my pain. It does vary from moment to moment within a day, from hour to hour, from day to day,
                from week to week, but measured over an entire month, it’s always consistently poor. </p>

            <p>And if she’s asking me to rate my pain right at the exact moment I’m at the office, it’s a pointless
                question. It may be the placebo effect, but I don’t often feel my worst when in a physician’s office. I
                mostly need treatment for all the other times when my pain is out of control.</p>

            <p>When playing The Pain Game, I’m not being dishonest with my prescriber. I am, rather, guesstimating what
                will best communicate how I feel because I need my medication. I admit I am dependent on — but not
                addicted to — the opioid I use. I am scared to death about what would happen if it were stopped and I
                had to go through violent withdrawal.</p>

            <section>
                <p><strong>Love</strong> encompasses a range of strong and positive emotional and mental states, from the most
                    sublime virtue
                    or good habit, the deepest interpersonal affection, to the simplest pleasure.[1] An example of this range of
                    meanings is that the love of a mother differs from the love of a spouse, which differs from the love for food.
                    Most commonly, love refers to a feeling of strong attraction and emotional <br>
                    <br>
            
                    Love is considered to be both positive and negative, with its virtue representing human kindness, compassion,
                    and affection—"the unselfish, loyal, and benevolent concern for the good of another"—and its vice representing a
                    human moral flaw akin to vanity, selfishness, amour-propre, and egotism. It may also describe compassionate and
                    affectionate actions towards other humans, oneself, or animals.[3] In its various forms, love acts as a major
                    facilitator of interpersonal relationships and, owing to its central psychological importance, is one of the
                    most common themes in the creative arts.[4][5] Love has been postulated to be a function that keeps human beings
                    together against menaces and to facilitate the continuation of the species. [6] <br><br>
            
                    Ancient Greek philosophers identified six forms of love: familial love (storge), friendly love or platonic love
                    (philia), romantic love (eros), self-love (philautia), guest love (xenia), and divine or unconditional love
                    (agape). Modern authors have distinguished further varieties of love: fatuous love, unrequited love, empty love,
                    companionate love, consummate love, infatuated love, amour de soi, and courtly love. Numerous cultures have also
                    distinguished Ren, Yuanfen, Mamihlapinatapai, Cafuné, Kama, Bhakti, Mettā, Ishq, Chesed, Amore, charity, Saudade
                    (and other variants or symbioses of these states), as culturally unique words, definitions, or expressions of
                    love in regard to specified "moments" currently lacking in the English language.[7] <br><br>
            
                    The color wheel theory of love defines three primary, three secondary, and nine tertiary love styles, describing
                    them in terms of the traditional color wheel. The triangular theory of love suggests intimacy, passion, and
                    commitment are core components of love. Love has additional religious or spiritual meaning. This diversity of
                    uses and meanings, combined with the complexity of the feelings involved, makes love unusually difficult to
                    consistently define, compared to other emotional states.

                <h2><i>Definitions</i></h2>
                <hr>
            
                <p>The word "love" can have a variety of related but distinct meanings in different contexts. Many other languages
                    use multiple words to express some of the different concepts that in English are denoted as "love"; one example
                    is the plurality of Greek concepts for "love" (agape, eros, philia, storge).[8] Cultural differences in
                    conceptualizing love make it difficult to establish a universal definition.[9]
            
                    Although the nature or essence of love is a subject of frequent debate, different aspects of the word can be
                    clarified by determining what is not love (antonyms of "love"). Love, as a general expression of positive
                    sentiment (a stronger form of like), is commonly contrasted with hate (or neutral apathy). As a less sexual and
                    more emotionally intimate form of romantic attachment, love is commonly contrasted with lust. As an
                    interpersonal relationship with romantic overtones, love is sometimes contrasted with friendship, although the
                    word love is often applied to close friendships or platonic love. Further possible ambiguities come with usages
                    like "girlfriend", "boyfriend", and "just good friends". <br>Abstractly discussed, love usually refers to a
                    feeling one person experiences for another person. Love often involves caring for, or identifying with, a person
                    or thing (cf. vulnerability and care theory of love), including oneself (cf. narcissism). In addition to
                    cross-cultural differences in understanding love, ideas about love have also changed greatly over time. Some
                    historians date modern conceptions of romantic love to courtly Europe during or after the Middle Ages, although
                    the prior existence of romantic attachments is attested by ancient love poetry.[10] <br><br>
            
                    The complex and abstract nature[clarification needed] of love often reduces its discourse to a
                    thought-terminating cliché. Several common proverbs regard love, from Virgil's "Love conquers all" to The
                    Beatles' "All You Need Is Love". St. Thomas Aquinas, following Aristotle, defines love as "to will the good of
                    another."[11][12] Bertrand Russell describes love as a condition of[clarification needed] "absolute value," as
                    opposed to relative value.[13] Philosopher Gottfried Leibniz said that love is "to be delighted by the happiness
                    of another."[14] Meher Baba stated that in love there is a "feeling of unity" and an "active appreciation of the
                    intrinsic worth of the object of love."[15] Biologist Jeremy Griffith defines love as "unconditional
                    selflessness".[16] According to Ambrose Bierce, love is a temporary insanity curable by marriage.[17] </p>

                <h2><i>Impersonal</i></h2>
    <hr>
    <p>People can express love towards things other than humans; this can range from expressing a strong liking of
        something, such as "I love popcorn" or that something is essential to one's identity, such as "I love being an
        actor".[18] <br><br>

        People can have a profound dedication and immense appreciation for an object, principle, or objective, thereby
        experiencing a sense of love towards it. For example, compassionate outreach and volunteer workers' "love" of
        their cause may sometimes be born not of interpersonal love but impersonal love, altruism, and strong spiritual
        or political convictions.[3] <br><br>

        People can also "love" material objects, animals, or activities if they invest themselves in bonding or
        otherwise identifying with those things. If sexual passion is also involved, then this feeling is called
        paraphilia.[19] <br><br></p>

                <h2><i>Interpersonal</i></h2>
                <hr>
                <p>Interpersonal love refers to love between human beings. It is a much more potent sentiment than liking a person.
                    Unrequited love refers to feelings of love that are not reciprocated. Interpersonal love is most closely
                    associated with interpersonal relationships.[3] Such love might exist between family members, friends, and
                    couples. There are several psychological disorders related to love, such as erotomania. <br><br> Throughout
                    history, philosophy and religion have speculated about the phenomenon of love. In the 20th century, the science
                    of psychology has studied the subject. The sciences of anthropology, neuroscience, and biology have also added
                    to the understanding of the concept of love.
                    <br>
                </p>
                <h2><b>Biological basis</b></h2>
                <p>Biological models of sex tend to view love as a mammalian[clarification needed] drive, much like hunger or
                    thirst.[20] Helen Fisher, an anthropologist and human behavior researcher, divides the experience of love into
                    three partly overlapping stages: lust, attraction, and attachment. Lust is the feeling of sexual desire;
                    romantic attraction determines what partners find attractive and pursue, conserving time and energy by
                    choosing[clarification needed]; and attachment involves sharing a home, parental duties, mutual defense, and in
                    humans involves feelings of safety and security.[21] Three distinct neural circuitries,[specify] including
                    neurotransmitters,[specify] and three behavioral patterns,[specify] are associated with[how?] these three
                    romantic styles.[21] <br> <br> Lust is the initial passionate sexual desire that promotes mating, and involves
                    the increased release of hormones such as testosterone and estrogen. These effects rarely last more than a few
                    weeks or months. Attraction is the more individualized and romantic desire for a specific candidate for mating,
                    which develops out of lust as commitment to an individual mate form. Recent studies in neuroscience have
                    indicated that as people fall in love, the brain consistently releases a certain set of chemicals, including the
                    neurotransmitter hormones dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin, the same compounds released by amphetamine,
                    stimulating the brain's pleasure center and leading to side effects such as increased heart rate, reduced
                    appetite and sleep, and an intense feeling of excitement. Research indicates that this stage generally lasts
                    from one and a half to three years.[22] <br> <br> Since the lust and attraction stages are both considered
                    temporary, a third stage is needed to account for long-term relationships. Attachment is the bonding that
                    promotes relationships lasting for many years and even decades. Attachment is generally based on commitments
                    such as marriage and children, or mutual friendship based on things like shared interests. It has been linked to
                    higher levels of the chemicals oxytocin and vasopressin, to a greater degree than what is found in short-term
                    relationships.[22] Enzo Emanuele and coworkers reported the protein molecule known as the nerve growth factor
                    (NGF) has high levels when people first fall in love, but these return to previous levels after one year.[23]

                <h2><strong>Psychological basis</strong></h2>
                <p>Psychology depicts love as a cognitive and social phenomenon. Psychologist Robert Sternberg formulated a
                    triangular theory of love in which love has three components: intimacy, commitment, and passion. Intimacy is
                    when two people share confidences and various details of their personal lives, and is usually shown in
                    friendships and romantic love affairs. Commitment is the expectation that the relationship is permanent.
                    Passionate love is shown in infatuation as well as romantic love. All forms of love are viewed as varying
                    combinations of these three components. Non-love does not include any of these components. Liking only includes
                    intimacy. Infatuated love only includes passion. Empty love only includes commitment. Romantic love includes
                    both intimacy and passion. Companionate love includes intimacy and commitment. Fatuous love includes passion and
                    commitment. Consummate love includes all three components.[24] <br> <br> American psychologist Zick Rubin sought
                    to define love by psychometrics in the 1970s. His work identifies a different set of three factors that
                    constitute love: attachment, caring, and intimacy.[25] <br> <br> Following developments in electrical theories
                    such as Coulomb's law, which showed that positive and negative charges attract, analogs in human life were
                    envisioned, such as "opposites attract". Research on human mating has generally found this not to be true when
                    it comes to character and personality—people tend to like people similar to themselves. However, in a few
                    unusual and specific domains, such as immune systems, it seems that humans prefer others who are unlike
                    themselves (e.g., with an orthogonal immune system), perhaps because this will lead to a baby that has the best
                    of both worlds.[26] <br> <br> Following developments in electrical theories such as Coulomb's law, which showed
                    that positive and negative charges attract, analogs in human life were envisioned, such as "opposites attract".

                    Psychologist Erich Fromm maintained in his book The Art of Loving that love is not merely a feeling but is also
                    actions, and that in fact the "feeling" of love is superficial in comparison to one's commitment to love via a
                    series of loving actions over time.[3] Fromm held that love is ultimately not a feeling at all, but rather is a
                    commitment to, and adherence to, loving actions towards another, oneself, or many others, over a sustained
                    duration.[3] Fromm also described love as a conscious choice that in its early stages might originate as an
                    involuntary feeling, but which then later no longer depends on those feelings, but rather depends only on
                    conscious commitment.[3] <br></p>
                <h2><strong>Evolutionary basis</strong></h2>
                <p>Evolutionary psychology has attempted to provide various reasons for love as a survival tool. Humans are
                    dependent on parental help for a large portion of their lifespans compared to other mammals. Love has therefore
                    been seen as a mechanism to promote parental support of children for this extended time period. Furthermore,
                    researchers as early as Charles Darwin identified unique features of human love compared to other mammals and
                    credited love as a major factor for creating social support systems that enabled the development and expansion
                    of the human species.[citation needed] Another factor may be that sexually transmitted diseases can cause, among
                    other effects, permanently reduced fertility, injury to the fetus, and increase complications during childbirth.
                    This would favor monogamous relationships over polygamy.[28] <br></p>

            <h2><strong>Adaptive benefit </strong></h2>
            <p>Interpersonal love between a man and woman provides an evolutionary adaptive benefit since it facilitates mating
                and sexual reproduction.[29] However, some organisms can reproduce asexually without mating. Understanding the
                adaptive benefit of interpersonal love depends on understanding the adaptive benefit of sexual reproduction as
                opposed to asexual reproduction. Richard Michod reviewed evidence that love, and consequently sexual
                reproduction, provides two major adaptive advantages.[29] First, sexual reproduction facilitates repair of
                damages in the DNA that is passed from parent to progeny (during meiosis, a key stage of the sexual process).
                Second, a gene in either parent may contain a harmful mutation, but in the progeny produced by sexual
                reproduction, expression of a harmful mutation introduced by one parent is likely to be masked by expression of
                the unaffected homologous gene from the other parent.[29] <br> </p>
            <h2><strong>Comparison of scientific models</strong></h2>
            <section>
                <p>Biological models of love tend to see it as a mammalian[clarification needed] drive, similar to hunger or
                    thirst.[20] Psychology sees love as more of a social and cultural phenomenon. Love is influenced by hormones
                    (such as oxytocin), neurotrophins (such as NGF), and pheromones, and how people think and behave in love is
                    influenced by their conceptions of love. The conventional view in biology is that there are two major drives in
                    love: sexual attraction and attachment. Attachment between adults is presumed to work on the same principles
                    that lead an infant to become attached to its mother. The traditional psychological view sees love as being a
                    combination of companionate love and passionate love. Passionate love is intense longing, and is often
                    accompanied by physiological arousal (shortness of breath, rapid heart rate); companionate love is affection and
                    a feeling of intimacy not accompanied by physiological arousal. <br> </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2><strong>Health</strong></h2>
                <p>Love plays a role in human well-being and health.[30][31] Engaging in activities associated with love, such as
                    nurturing relationships, has been shown to activate key brain regions responsible for emotion, attention,
                    motivation, and memory. These activities also contribute to the regulation of the autonomic nervous system,
                    leading to stress reduction over time, although the initial stages of love may induce stress.[30] Love's social
                    bonds enhance both physical and mental health, fostering resilience, compassion, and closeness. It boosts immune
                    function and promotes healing, while also encouraging positive motivations and behaviors for individual
                    flourishing and survival.[30] Breakups can evoke a range of emotional states, including distrust, rejection, and
                    anger, leading to trauma and various psychological challenges such as anxiety, social withdrawal, and even love
                    addiction. Individuals may become fixated on past relationships, perpetuating emotional distress akin to
                    addiction.[32] Health benefits grow bigger when married couples are older, this is because the partners play a
                    crucial role in promoting each other's well-being.[33] A loving relationship with God has significant impact on
                    health.[31]
